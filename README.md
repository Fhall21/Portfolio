# Wagtail Freelancer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AccordBox/wagtail-freelancer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AccordBox/wagtail-freelancer)

This project is a combination of [startbootstrap-freelancer](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-freelancer) and [Wagtail CMS](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail), you can use Wagtail StreamField feature to quickly edit the content of the page.

This project was originally built by Micheal and was edited for my own purposes. Feel free to check out his [Wagtail Tutorial Series](https://blog.michaelyin.info/wagtail-tutorials/)

It has since been extended for personal purposes. An example of this is the additional perosnal booking system which makes use of the DjangoRestFramework and Angular.
